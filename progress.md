# Progress

Living status tracker for the systematic options research & paper-trading
platform. Update this file at the end of every work session — append,
don't rewrite history.

## Status: Phase 0 — design deliverables complete, foundations not started

## 2026-09-19

- Received the full platform spec (Claude Code + Python 3.12+ + Anthropic
  API + Postgres + broker abstraction (IBKR/Schwab) + backtesting +
  deterministic risk engine, targeting ~12–15% annualized with capital
  preservation as the top priority).
- Explicit instruction for this session: architecture and planning only,
  no trading-system implementation yet.
- Delivered:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — component map, LLM/Python trust boundary, trading
    mode gate design (LIVE not implemented, not just disabled), risk
    engine responsibilities, broker abstraction, end-to-end data flow,
    security risks, trading-system failure modes, open questions.
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — folder structure (`src/options_platform/`
    layout), dependency list, 8-phase delivery plan (Phase 0 Foundations
    → Phase 7 Hardening), explicit non-goals for this phase.
  - `progress.md` (this file).
- **Note:** before this spec arrived, a small unrelated prototype was
  started directly under `app/` at the repo root (Black-Scholes/Greeks
  solver, synthetic mock option-chain provider, Pydantic chain models) for
  an earlier, much narrower "options analysis dashboard" request. It does
  not follow the architecture in this plan (no `src/` layout, no DB, no
  risk gate, no broker/agent separation) and has **not** been deleted or
  merged into the new plan — left as-is pending a decision (see
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §3). The Greeks/IV-solver code in
  `app/analytics/greeks.py` is a reasonable seed for
  `src/options_platform/quant/greeks.py` and is worth porting rather than
  rewriting when Phase 0/1 starts.
- Committed and pushed to `claude/options-trading-agent-2b4yi8`: the three
  planning docs (`a8dfa0d`) and the `app/` prototype as-is, clearly labeled
  as not part of the plan (`6be729c`).

## 2026-09-19 (cont'd) — Multi-Agent Layer refinement

- User supplied a specific orchestration design for the LLM layer: a
  Claude Opus-tier **Portfolio Manager** coordinating three sub-agents
  (**Market Agent**, **Strategy Analyst**, **Adversarial Reviewer**),
  feeding a two-stage Python verification (**Python Quant** → **Python
  Risk Engine**) before **Paper Broker**.
- Folded this into `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  - New §5 "Multi-Agent Layer" defines all four roles, their inputs,
    outputs, and tools — every role still bound by the same read-only /
    no-trusted-numbers constraints from §2.
  - Split the former single "Risk Engine" section into §6 "Python Quant"
    (pure per-trade calculation: Greeks, P&L, max loss, EV — no portfolio
    state, no policy) and §7 "Python Risk Engine" (portfolio policy and
    gating: sizing, exposure, correlation, drawdown, RiskGate, circuit
    breaker) to match the two-box separation in the supplied diagram.
  - Redrew the §3 component map top-to-bottom through the new pipeline:
    Scheduler → Market Data → Strategy Screener → Multi-Agent Layer →
    Python Quant → Python Risk Engine → trading-mode gate → Broker
    Abstraction Layer.
  - Updated §9 data flow to match (screener output feeds the agent layer;
    agent proposals are non-numeric intent objects; Quant reprices from
    the live snapshot; Risk Engine gates before the mode gate).
  - Added a "multi-agent groupthink" failure mode to §11 (the Adversarial
    Reviewer's prompt is deliberately adversarial rather than
    collaborative; either way, Python Risk Engine is the actual backstop,
    not agent consensus).
  - Added open question 5 (§12): model tier per role — Opus-tier
    recommended for the Portfolio Manager, sub-agent tiers configurable.
- Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: split the `risk/` package into
  `quant/` (greeks, pnl, max_loss, expected_value) and `risk/` (sizing,
  exposure, correlation, drawdown, limits, circuit_breaker); expanded
  `agent/` into per-role modules (`portfolio_manager.py`,
  `market_agent.py`, `strategy_analyst.py`, `adversarial_reviewer.py`)
  plus the shared `schemas.py`/`tools.py`/`audit.py`; updated Phase 1 and
  renamed Phase 5 to "Multi-Agent Layer" with the four-role breakdown.
- Still design-only — no `src/options_platform/` code exists yet; this was
  a documentation refinement, not a Phase 0 start.

## Open decisions carried forward (see ARCHITECTURE.md §10)

- [ ] Historical options data vendor for backtesting (Phase 2 blocker)
- [ ] Schwab paper-trading / sandbox capability (Phase 4 blocker) — needs
      research against current Schwab developer docs, not assumed
- [ ] Sector/classification data source for correlation/concentration checks
- [ ] Final ~50-name equity universe list + liquidity criteria
- [ ] What happens to the pre-existing `app/` prototype (port vs. delete)

## Next up

- Awaiting review/approval of `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
  before starting Phase 0 (repo scaffolding, DB schema, CI, and a decision
  on the `app/` prototype).
